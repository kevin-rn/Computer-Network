/*
Tutorial (Optional)

THIS TUTORIAL IS OPTIONAL

In this tutorial you will learn how to work with bitwise operators. This tutorial is not required to pass assignment 1, but can be helpful in case you are not familiar with bitwise operators. We show how to accomplish certain tasks through combining multiple of these operators. It is not needed to change any of the code. It acts as a playground for you to experiment in.

So what are bitwise operators? Bitwise operators are special operators within programming languages that make it possible to change values on a bit-level. Meaning that an integer like 6, would be represented as 110 (excluding leading zeros). We can now apply binary operations to this representation, to accomplish results that would be inefficient to do at integer level. Speed is also the main advantage of bitwise operators.

This tutorial will cover:
- Converting between binary and integer notations for debugging
- Creating bit sequences from scratch
- Flipping a bit in a certain position of a bit sequence
- Prepending a bit sequence
- Appending a bit sequence
- Changing a bit sequence
- Inserting values in between bit sequences

Below you can find examples of often used constructs. These will be provided as hints in the other assignments.
